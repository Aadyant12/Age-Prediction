# Age-Prediction

A Machine Learning algorithm to detect the age bracket (0-18yrs, 18-24yrs...) of a social user based on his activity on the internet.
Several parameters, such as the number of followers, number of people the user is following, number of comments, number of emojis used, number of punctuation marks used etc, are used to categorize the users.
